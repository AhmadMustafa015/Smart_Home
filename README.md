## Smart_Room
In this project we have designed and implemented a smart room system using several sensors and i/o devices. At the heart of the system is a PIC16F877A microcontroller. The system reads the temperature, light intensity, and motion in the room. According to the readings the cooling and lighting of the room are controlled. The room is initially locked and can be accessed using a password, which is entered using a keypad.
The code was written in MPLAB with assembly language and then tested in Proteus.
